Dataview 0.4.0 has been released (likely with a large quantity of bugs...); this is largely an internal rework to
simplify implementing new features, but comes with some niceties, and a lot of bug fixes!

#### Multi-threaded Parsing & Loading

Dataview now uses several background webworkers to parse files, improving index time dramatically and preventing
dataview from freezing the frontend. This also fixes several issues with views not being refreshed - they should
properly update when Dataview starts and when files are renamed or deleted.

#### Inline JS Blocks

You can write inline DataviewJS now using the syntax `\`$= dv...`\`, which acts much like a normal inline field. It will
render whatever value the JS evaluates to - so `$= 6` or `$= "hello"` or `$= dv.pages("#tag").file.name` or so on.

#### Use Dataview Functions From DataviewJS

You can now access any dataview function from DataviewJS via the `dv.func` map - for example, `dv.func.date()`,
`dv.func.join()`, and so on.
